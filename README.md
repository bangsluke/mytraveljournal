# MyTravelJournal

## Set Up

### Python Set Up

To install all of the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install json os markdown2 obsidiantools neomodel
```

## Getting Started

### Next.js Start Up

Created using: `npx create-next-app@latest --ts mytraveljournal`

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

### Python Start Up

#### Python API

To start up the flask server, run:

```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```

The `app.py` file is located in the `backend` directory. The server will be running on `http://localhost:5000/api/data`.
