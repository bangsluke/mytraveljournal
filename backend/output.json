Smoked weed in the park, visited the [[Zoo]] and went to a sex museum as well as visiting the Red Light district. Stayed at the Amigo Budget [[Hostel]].</p>\n\n<h2>[[Berlin]] - 28th July - 31st July</h2>\n\n<p>Got a train over to [[Berlin]] and did some cultural tours of the city such as visiting the Jewish memorial and seeing the car park that Hitler is buried under. Had some big nights out with all the various nationalities staying in our [[Hostel]], called Baxpax Downtown Hostel.</p>\n\n<h2>[[Prague]] - 31st July - 03rd August</h2>\n\n<p>In [[Prague]] we toured the city and visited its castle before a big messy night (see below key memories). Also visited a funny wax works museum. Stayed at the Penzion Sprint [[Hostel]] (which was far too far out of the city center).</p>\n\n<h2>[[Krak\u00f3w]] - 04th August - 08th August</h2>\n\n<p>Next was [[Krak\u00f3w]] where we arrived a day early by accident and visited some salt mines and got a bus out to Auschwitz Birkenau to do a tour. Also visited the Wieliczka Salt Mine and saw the St. Kinga Chapel. Had a big night out with some Aussies we met at the Atlantis [[Hostel]].</p>\n\n<h2>[[Budapest]] - 08th August - 11th August</h2>\n\n<p>[[Budapest]] was possibly my favourite city we visited as the vibes there were incredible in the sun sitting drinking by the fountains. Had a big night at the Spa party (see below) and also got asked aggressively to leave a Sports bar where we were watching the start of the Championship as a dodgy poker game had started behind us. Stayed at the Fifth [[Hostel]].</p>\n\n<h2>[[Zagreb]] - 11th August - 13th August</h2>\n\n<p>Spent our time grumpily walking around the city completely broke and unable to do anything fun. Stayed at the Maju Jaya [[Hostel]]. Flew from [[Zagreb]] to [[Stuttgart]] and home to [[Heathrow]], both with [[German Wings]].</p>\n\n<p>Key memories:\n- [[Spa]] party in the public baths in [[Budapest]] and getting incredibly drunk in the hot pools before realising I was practically standing in an orgy\n- Thinking the free shots in a bar in [[Prague]] were just juice, having far too many and leaving the pub crawl we were on at the first bar. Then stumbled into the square to hear English tourists singing Wonderwall which Oli loved and Luke didn\u2019t. Argued over which way to go at the bridge (Luke was right) and walked 7 back to the hostel. Worst hangover ever sat in McDonald\u2019s watching a Sparta Prague training session</p>\n",

Landed and were collected by Patrizio and driven madly through [[Naples]] to our [[Airbnb]]. Walked miles through Naples to the port and then stopped in a cafe to eat pizza and buffalo mozzarella. Found a domed shopping centre and met a man who couldn\u2019t speak but explained the star signs on the floor and made us spin round next to the Virgo sign and make a wish. Went back to the flat for a nap and then walked out for the evening to eat a cone of fried food and a rum baba.</p>\n\n<h1>Tuesday 20th - Naples</h1>\n\n<p>Woke up and went for a run up a steep hill to some gardens. Walked back down and had breakfast. Walked to [[Naples]] botanical gardens. Had lunch in the flat and napped. Walked to the catacombs of [[Naples]] which were empty of bodies. Had pizza for dinner and pistachio ice cream and limoncello pastry cone for dessert.</p>\n\n<h1>Wednesday 21st - Naples/Pompeii</h1>\n\n<p>Picked up the car (Toyota Corolla) and drove to [[Pompeii]]. Walked into [[Pompeii]] and had mini pizzas with salami for lunch. Walked around the ruins of [[Pompeii]]. Rudely pushed past lots of people and got shouted at by a tour guide. Walked home and napped for too long. Walked into [[Pompeii]] and had pizza, spaghetti carbonara and melon and ham for dinner. Visited [[Pompeii]] town square and then had a pastry and limoncello slushie before going home.</p>\n\n<h1>Thursday 22nd - Pompeii/Sorrento</h1>\n\n<p>Ran to the beach front of [[Pompeii]]. Drove along the [[Amalfi Coast]] across Fiordo di Furore, and onto [[Positano]]. Walked down to [[Positano]] beach and ate a pizza and bruschetta. Walked back up and drove onto [[Sorrento]]. Put our fancy clothes on and went for dinner in town in a restaurant where they rolled their eyes at us. Lasagna and veal was tasty though.</p>\n\n<h1>Friday 23rd - Sorrento/Rome</h1>\n\n<p>Had bread and ham for breakfast on the terrace. Drove as far up [[Mount Vesuvius]] as we could and then walked the remainder of the way up to the crater. Drove to [[Rome]] passing the [[Vatican]]. Walked into the centre to see the Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain. Had pizza and carbonara pasta for dinner.</p>\n\n<h1>Saturday 24th - Rome/Florence</h1>\n\n<p>Woke up early and had yogurt drinks for breakfast. Walked to the Vatican and walked around the Basilica and the Tombs of the Popes. Got fast track entry for the Vatican Museum and Sistine Chapel. Walked as fast as we could through the museum and into the chapel. Both a little disappointed \ud83d\ude14. Drove out of [[Rome]] past the [[Colosseum]]. Visited the Tivoli fountains. Drove 5 and a half hours to get to our house in [[Florence]]. Had a McDonalds as everything was shut when we arrived.</p>\n\n<h1>Sunday 25th - Florence</h1>\n\n<p>Woke up without an alarm and went shopping for breakfast lunch and dinner. Came back and had bread and jam before going out to the pool. Chilled in the sun and did a dance competition in the water. Went back into the flat, had a salad for lunch and then had a long nap. Woke up and went back in the pool with some frogs until we got attacked by biting flies. Watch Pirates of the Caribbean whilst drinking wine and beer and then had pesto pasta for dinner.</p>\n\n<h1>Monday 26th - Florence</h1>\n\n<p>Woke up late (bliss). Had breakfast of bread and jam with yoghurt. Went for a swim and [[Luke]] did 100 lengths of the pool. Sunbathed. Had lunch of the remaining pesto pasta which was delicious. Napped for a while and watched TV. Did some of [[Bryony]]\u2019s work. Swam some more. Went out for dinner at a local restaurant (Girodibacco) which was the best meal so far. Had a tasty bean salad to start followed by chicken liver starter. Then had pulled pork with roast potatoes which was fucking amazing. Literally. [[Luke]] then said no to dessert like a mental person.</p>\n\n<h1>Tuesday 27th - Florence/Pisa</h1>\n\n<p>Woke up early and left the flat. Drove into [[Florence]] and had a sandwich and pastries for breakfast. Walked to the Cathedral Duomo in Florence and then up to Michelangelo\u2019s viewpoint to have a milkshake. Drove to [[Pisa]] and climbed the Leaning Tower of Pisa before having a pizza and some cold meats with cheese for lunch. Drove to our tipi [[Airbnb]] and had Prosecco in the whirlpool. Had a delicious dinner of four courses; figs and Parma ham and bruschetta, then homemade pasta bolognese, then roast beef with tomatoes and finished with fresh blackberries and ice cream.</p>\n\n<h1>Wednesday 28th - Pisa/Cinque de Terre</h1>\n\n<p>Woke up late in the tipi and had a breakfast of eggs on toast and some cakes and biscuits. Drove to the city of [[Lucca]]. Carried onto [[Cinque de Terre]] and rested in the [[Airbnb]] after grabbing a takeaway pizza and pasta for lunch. Walked down through the town to the waterfront and had some pasta on the walk back up.</p>\n\n<h1>Thursday 29th - Cinque de Terre/Genoa</h1>\n\n<p>Woke up and had a breakfast of toast, croissants, cake and jam on the patio. Tried to drive to a small beach en route to [[Genoa]], got as far as we could but then realised you couldn\u2019t drive all the way to it. Instead drove to [[Genoa]] and found a beach. Gambled on the all Italian menu and ended up with tuna pasta (proper fishy tuna though \ud83e\udd22) and mussel spaghetti. Went for a swim in the sea. Dropped Bry off at the apartment and then drove the car to the airport to drop it off, only just remembering to fill it with petrol. They didn\u2019t look at the scrapes on the front bumper \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb. Rested and then went to the Aquarium. Saw Manatees, sharks and dolphins and [[Bryony]] played with a seal. Had dinner in the port area and both had pizza. Walked back to the flat with a crepe and a frappe.</p>\n\n<h1>Friday 30th - Genoa</h1>\n\n<p>Had a long lie in and then packed. Walked to find a taxi to the airport. Ordered hot milk by accident rather than a latte. Flew home.</p>\n\n<p>Key memories:\n- TBC</p>\n",

Took a taxi to the apartment and left our bags at our [[Airbnb]] called Apartinfo Gustinelli Anton's. Walked into the city centre and explored the old town. Sat down for a coffee and a piece of cake and saw a tall tower with a viewing platform. Climbed the 410 step tower to get a great view. Grabbed a pizza and a pastry for lunch and then walked along the river. Made our way back to the apartment for a nap. Came out for dinner and went to La Pampa steakhouse for a large ribeye.</p>\n\n<h1>Tuesday 29th October</h1>\n\n<p>Had a lie in and woke up with breakfast in bed. Walked to the WW2 museum which was harrowing but incredible. Walked back and had pasta for lunch before going back to the flat for a nap. Came out and went to Jacks Legendary bar for burgers. Went to a cocktail bar and got pissed (especially [[Bryony]]).</p>\n\n<h1>Wednesday 30th October</h1>\n\n<p>Had a big lie in and relaxed in bed all morning. Had a cooked breakfast before heading out. Walked up to the shopping centre and then walked up to the science museum in the hills and walked around the exhibitions. Went back to the shopping centre as had a coffee and got chocolate. Headed back to the flat and ordered Chinese and watched a film/[[Luke]] watched football ([[Liverpool]] beat Arsenal on penalties after a 5-5 draw in the Carabao Cup).</p>\n\n<h1>Thursday 31st October</h1>\n\n<p>Had toast for breakfast and then walked into town to go on the walking tour. Spent 2.5 hours having a tour of the city and seeing where the first shots of WW2 took place. Went back to the flat for some lunch and then went to the immersion floating tank for an hour. Both found it boring so went back to watch a film. Then went out for pizza and steak.</p>\n\n<p>Key memories:\n- TBC</p>\n",

Decided it was too expensive to go in, so walked the gardens to the [[Zoo]] instead, to see Koalas, Pandas and Polar Bears. Then went back to the [[hotel]] room, had a nap and went to the pool and spa and had a laugh with the tired [[Spa]] receptionist man. For dinner we tried 2 separate schnitzel places, both too booked, tried another 3 recommendations from Tripadvisor before ending up in a burger restaurant. Then had an awkward drink in the [[hotel]] bar.</p>\n\n<h1>Saturday 4th June</h1>\n\n<p>Had another late breakfast and walked to the Museum of Illusions which was great. Walked around the historic centre, refused to pay \u00a35 for a fridge magnet, stopped for a beer and drink and then got the tram to the Belvedere Palace. Paid the cheapest entrance fee for the lower palace to see the artwork all about [[Venice]] weirdly. Walked back to the [[hotel]], had a nap, went to the gym and then the spa.

Had a pastry in the airport before boarding and flying 2.5 hours to [[Bergamo]] with [[RyanAir]]. Had a shared pizza for lunch and then checked into our lovely [[Airbnb]]. Walked up into [[Bergamo]] and up into Citia Alta which was beautiful. Visited three churches/cathedrals and then climbed up a castle viewpoint. Had ice cream (papaya) and a mixed up slushy (lemon, orange and toothpaste mint) and then walked back towards the [[Airbnb]] after it started raining. Stopped at a micro brewery for a few strong beers and then returned home to eat the best takeaway pizza we\u2019ve ever eaten.</p>\n\n<h1>Thursday 18th August</h1>\n\n<p>Woke up to the heaviest rain, packed up and left our apartment in [[Bergamo]] to drive towards [[Lake Como]]. We stopped in [[Como]] and wandered around to have a drink and walk along the pier, before driving around the whole lake clockwise, stopping for pizza, soup and a decaf espresso and some views, finishing in [[Lecco]]. Our last leg was up the inside right leg of the lake to [[Bellagio]] where our apartment was. We wandered up into the city, had some cocktails and then a pasta dinner which was delicious.</p>\n\n<h1>Friday 19th August</h1>\n\n<p>Had breakfast in our apartment in [[Bellagio]] and then drove to [[Como]] to do a food walking tour with a tour guide called Pier and an Irish couple. Tasted hams, a Prosecco, some Rose, pizza and then polenta with fish, finishing the tour in Piers spice shop drinking coffee. Walked back to the car and drove to [[Milan]] to our new apartment where we then ate the apricot cloud brioche bread we also got on the tour. Had a short nap and then got the Metro into [[Milan]] centre and walked aimlessly around (accidentally walking into a University) before having some cocktails, one of which was Amaro and was awful, before coming back to the apartment. Ordered pizza and watched [[Netflix]].</p>\n\n<h1>Saturday 20th August</h1>\n\n<p>Had breakfast on the balcony looking out over [[Milan]]. Travelled into [[Milan]] and begun the online scavenger hunt, discovering churches, a Devils Column (which [[Bryony]] wouldn\u2019t let [[Luke]] touch) and an Italian war memorial which was incredible like the Octagon. Luke got hangry (it was also 33 degrees) and we walked around until deciding to go back to the same cafe we first saw for pastries. Then went to the Museum of [[Leonardo De Vinci]] and Technology which was massive and endless. Then walked back to the Duomo, had a small pizza and toured the Cathedral and climbed it. Returned home to rest and then came back out to a steakhouse where we had pork ribs and steak which was banging.</p>\n\n<h1>Sunday 21st August\u00a0</h1>\n\n<p>Left pretty early to head towards [[Lake Garda]], starting pretty terribly as Luke drove into the bus lane. Picked up groceries and drove for 2 hours until we reached the lake where we had pizza on a small pier overlooking the lake. Finished the drive up to the top where we arrived at the camp site. Had a long nap, then swam and went into the sauna on the site before walking down into the beautiful town of Riva Del Garda for food in a bar and then ice cream on the walk home.</p>\n\n<h1>Monday 22nd August</h1>\n\n<p>Had breakfast outside surrounded by the mountains and then drove to the south of the lake to [[Lake Garda]]\u2019s thermal park. Chilled around the thermal pools and swam in them, in the caves and under the various fountains. Ate 3 variant pastries of mozzarella pizza and had an ice cream, before leaving. Were 5 minutes late to the wine tour of 25 people but then had a great tour before we started drinking. Tried 7 wines, rating each out of ten and getting to know the other tour guests such as Maxime, the vibrant and very drunk Dutch girl. Bryony also brilliantly drunk. Luke trying to stay sober. Drove home and somehow got pulled over by the police but waved away with nothing. Ordered takeaway pizza and schnitzel and watched United beat [[Liverpool]]\u00a0\ud83d\ude43</p>\n\n<h1>Tuesday 23rd August\u00a0</h1>\n\n<p>Woke up and had breakfast once again outside amongst the views, before leaving the campsite and driving to a small beach (Spiaggia di Torbole) at the top of the lake. Swam in the fresh water for a while before driving down the right hand side of the lake to Castle of Malcesine where we had lunch of bruschetta and pizza. We completed the full drive to Verona and checked in to our room before a quick nap. Then we walked into the centre of Verona and did another scavenger hunt to see the sites, climbing the clock tower and accidentally ending up in mass in one church. Had a dinner of schnitzel with a lot of alcohol (cocktails, wine and 2.5L of beer) before staggering home.</p>\n\n<h1>Wednesday 24th August</h1>\n\n<p>Had a quick breakfast in our apartment and then drove from [[Verona]] to our room in Marghera just outside of [[Venice]]. We had some time to kill so we went to Museo del \u2018900, an interactive museum about Italian life which was actually great fun and took some very funny photos of ourselves as Italians growing up. Then we stopped in at the room to drop our bags off before getting the train into Venice. We did another scavenger hunt tour, visiting several churches and squares before stopping for a very expensive beer and Prosecco and being fed lots of free chocolate in a chocolate store, before heading back out the city. Had a pizza and steak for dinner and went to bed.</p>\n\n<h1>Thursday 25th August</h1>\n\n<p>Drove to the airport and struggled to operate the manual self service pump but made it on time. Had some final pizza at the airport for breakfast and then flew home with [[EasyJet]] back to [[Gatwick]].</p>\n\n<p>Key memories:\n- TBC</p>\n",

Flew over with [[EasyJet]] after a breakfast burrito. Arrived in [[Santorini]] and picked up the car (Peugeot 305 convertible) and drove to a restaurant close to the [[Airbnb]] to meet the host - also went down the wrong street and had to do a scary 967 point turn. Had a Greek salad and beer until she arrived. Checked into our villa, had a swim and a sunbathe before [[Bryony]] napped. Then had dinner with [[Martin]], [[Andrea]], [[Ross]] and [[Tara]] of kebabs, souvlaki and dips.</p>\n\n<h1>Monday 8th August</h1>\n\n<p>Woke up late and then relaxed in our villa having a swim, a read and a sunbathe. Around midday we travelled to where [[Bryony]]\u2019s family were stay and spent the afternoon in the pool with them. Then [[Luke]] went off for a wine tasting tour with his family and visited three wineries with a tour guide called Angello and three American ladies. Tried some great wines paired with food and bought back a bottle of rose and a sweet wine. [[Bryony]] meanwhile chilled at her families villa before going out to dinner with them for moussaka and then having a late night pool party until 1am.</p>\n\n<h1>Tuesday 9th August\u00a0</h1>\n\n<p>[[Luke]] drove over to [[Bryony]]s family villa to pick her up, then we went grocery shopping, before returning to our villa for lunch. Had a very chilled day around the villa, sunbathing reading and a naked pool swim. Then went out to a traditional Greek taverna (the Good Heart) for food with both sides of the family. Lovely meal and everyone got on well with [[Henry]] and [[Ross]] bonding the highlight. Came back to the villa for some Rose on the rooftop.</p>\n\n<h1>Wednesday 10th August</h1>\n\n<p>Woke up casually and had a swim and a read. Then drove to a bakery close to the wedding venue for a pre wedding meeting. Visited the venue and finalised timings before having lunch at the bakery. Came home and chilled. Had dinner at the nearby restaurant and ate far too much so lay in bed and watched [[Netflix]].</p>\n\n<h1>Thursday 11th August</h1>\n\n<p>Wedding day! We chilled around the house all morning, swimming, sunbathing and napping, waiting for the main activities to start. Drove to Brys parents for lunch and then took the ladies to the venue to have their hair and makeup done. Meanwhile Luke went to his parents to get ready. Then, just after 5pm we all met at the venue, [[El Viento]] and began the ceremony. The celebrant could barely speak English which was hilarious but we just about managed through our vows with Brys bringing tears to peoples eyes. [[Henry]] then presented the rings in a small box and we were declared married. We cut the cake and drank Prosecco before setting off for a photo shoot in the nearby village of [[Megalochori]] where we took lots of photos instructed by the photographer. We returned to [[El Viento]] and had our first dance to \u201cBetter Half of Me\u201d before doing speeches ([[Ross]] and Luke) and eating a four course dinner (Greek salad, meatballs, lasagna and baklava and cake). After dinner we had fireworks and Greek dancers before smashing plates. Then we continued to disco until midnight when everyone left and we retreated to the accommodation at [[El Viento]].</p>\n\n<h1>Friday 12th August</h1>\n\n<p>Woke up with the amazing view out across the cliffs and had a swim in the infinity pool before having breakfast brought to us. Packed up and left the venue to return to our villa for a nap. Drove up the top of the hill/mountain to the highest point in [[Santorini]] for the view and visited a small monastery. Tried 4 wines with food at one of the wineries before going out for food with Bryony\u2019s family.</p>\n\n<h1>Saturday 13th August</h1>\n\n<p>We had a cooking class with [[Andrea]] and [[Martin]] in [[Megalochori]] at 11am. We cooked tzatziki, tomato frittas, Greek salad, shrimp saganaki and a Moussaka before eating it all outside in the sun. Came home and relaxed until going out again with them and [[Ross]] and [[Tara]] to Kamari beach where we had dinner and a cocktail.</p>\n\n<h1>Sunday 14th August</h1>\n\n<p>Woke up and had breakfast before heading to the supermarket to get food for Brys family who we\u2019re coming over to our villa to crash until their flight. Played in the pool with [[Henry]] and chatted with them over lunch until they left around 4pm. Had a drink at the nearby restaurant and then returned for a nap. Drove down to Perissa beach and wandered along the black sand and rocks which [[Bryony]] described as if someone had spilled lots of glue in the ocean. Had a couple of banging Gyros pitta wraps and some drinks before returning home.</p>\n\n<h1>Monday 15th August</h1>\n\n<p>Woke up very early and had a quick breakfast before driving up the island to [[Oia]] where we walked up and down the town looking at the views and shops. Then drove back down the island, stopping at a stoney beach with no one on but bailing as it was sus and then carrying on down to [[Fira]] where we did more walking (couldn\u2019t turn left as left is for losers) and looking at shops with a bit of food and coffee. Returned back to the villa where Bryony had her daily nap. Chilled for a long time by the pool, really topping up our tan before going into Megalochori for a taverna dinner. Returned back to the villa to watch [[Liverpool]] vs Palace. 1-1 (stupid Nunez red card and worldie Diaz goal).</p>\n\n<h1>Tuesday 16th August</h1>\n\n<p>Woke up early and had breakfast before driving to Red beach, and luckily we were one of the first there. It was beautifully clear water and the cliffs were deep red and we swam and then sunbathed until two giant waves managed to reach us. Came back to the villa for lunch and then played in the pool, competing to see who could do the best water gymnastics. In the evening we drove to try to get to White beach but couldn\u2019t, got mugged off at the petrol station paying for fuel we didn\u2019t receive and drove to the lighthouse at the tip of the island. Had dinner at the Good Heart again and came home.</p>\n\n<p>Key memories:\n- TBC</p>\n",

Arrived in [[Edinburgh]] in good time except [[RyanAir]] had lost our bags briefly as the airport staff hadn\u2019t bothered taking the bags to the baggage reclaim as there were only 18 bags which they assumed had been lost property. Caught the tram into the city, which was rammed full of Scottish and Welsh fans for the Six Nations match that day. Had lunch in a small Red Cockerel Cafe where [[Bryony]] stole the quiche from an old lady and [[Luke]] tried haggis and some weird christmas cake sandwich thing. Walked through the city and checked into our accommodation before having a nap. Explored the city a little more in the evening, ending up in Franco Manca for Bryony to try a pizza with roast potatoes on.</p>\n\n<h1>Sunday 12th February</h1>\n\n<p>Got up and went to grab a breakfast from Sainsburys before lounging around to watch old Top Gear specials. Eventually moved off the sofa to walk up to the Old Town and see the outside of [[Edinburgh]] castle and explore the surrounding streets. Couldn\u2019t find anywhere for lunch and so back to Sainsburys for a packed homemade sandwich and a rest in the flat. Then joined a Harry Potter, Haggis &amp; Horrible Histories tour around the city, visiting the place where JK Rowling had invented Harry Potter (which had burned down \u2013 but thankfully they saved JK\u2019s table) and seeing the graveyard where she got names from such as Tom Riddle. Had a delightful steak meal at Hawksmoor using a voucher to minimise the painfully high cost before getting more drinks before bed.</p>\n\n<h1>Monday 13th February</h1>\n\n<p>Had a quick breakfast and headed off back up to [[Edinburgh]] Castle for early entry. Outside the castle, Bryony held a tiny little owl called Einstein due to his grey fluffy hair. Entered the castle and downloaded the children\u2018s tour guide and explored the castle before having a delightful Afternoon Tea in the fancy castle restaurant. Then tried to walk off the cakes by walking and climbing 8km up Arthur\u2019s seat and back down, getting lost on the way back down trying to be smart and avoid the crowds. Had a brief rest back at the flat and then headed back out for a burger at the Queen\u2019s Arms, where Bry weirdly smelt the smoke from her Old Fashioned cloche and watched a successful Merseyside derby.</p>\n\n<h1>Tuesday 14th February</h1>\n\n<p>Spent a leisurely morning watching Clarkson\u2019s Farm and waking up slowly on the sofa before checking out from the [[Airbnb]] at 11am. Headed into the Old Town and to the National Museum of [[Scotland]] to explore their exhibits (and use their lockers for our bags). Quickly became tired of the random collection of items so nipped out for a pub lunch of pub grub bites before getting the tram back to the Airport. [[EasyJet]] flight was far more enjoyable than on the way out with a spare seat next to us, although the man in front elbowed Bry\u2019s head and then blocked everyone getting off so he could leave first.</p>\n\n<p>Key memories:\n- TBC</p>\n",

Immediately questioned. [[Luke]] decides to answer for [[Bryony]] to avoid her being embarrassed. Ridiculed for not letter her answer. Great show overall.</p>\n\n<p>Finished with a tapas meal with a banging pork burger and then a chocolate milkshake from Eddie Rockets on the wall home.</p>\n\n<h1>Saturday 3rd June</h1>\n\n<p>Woke up and walked to the nearest train station, grabbing a pain au chocolat and a pastry from a nearby cafe.

Arrived in [[Krak\u00f3w]] and waited for an hour for non-EU passport control but at least we have our shores back. Took the train into the centre and found our way to our [[hotel]] room, called Central Palace, which was excellent. Had a quick lunch of pretzels \ud83e\udd68 and then joined a walking tour around [[Krak\u00f3w]] Old Town, climbing up to the castle to finish. Wandered back down to see the [[Krak\u00f3w]] dragon blowing flames before heading into the centre to have beers and cocktails in the central square at Europejska cafe. Had a great dinner of ribs, dumplings and cabbage pancakes at Go\u015bcinna Chata Restaurant before heading back to bed.</p>\n\n<h2>Tuesday 8th August</h2>\n\n<p>Woke up and walked into the nearby train station to grab breakfast from a Carrefour. Took our yogurt and granola back to our apartment and had some coffee and chilled for a bit, booking up activities for the following days. Walked into the town centre, visited the Basilica in the central square and had a lunch of Polish soup in a bread bowl and a chicken broth at Chopin Restaurant. Did a Secret Spy mission walking around [[Krak\u00f3w]] solving clues and having a laugh, including having to do a secret set of instructions in a public square and whispering a secret word to an undercover agent. Finished the mission successfully and had a beer in the square listening to the Hungarian music for culture day. Walked back to our apartment and Bryony had a nap before still managing to wake up grumpy. Considered a takeaway but managed to get up, shower and walk into the square again to eat at Sioux. Bryony had a steak and Luke a burger and we quickly evacuated as we thought a gas burner was going to explode.</p>\n\n<h2>Wednesday 9th August</h2>\n\n<p>Got up early and had a quick breakfast of granola and yogurt. Caught the train over to visit the Wieliczka Salt Mine and saw the St. Kinga Chapel and various other chambers. Had some pork knuckle, turkey kiev and chips for lunch over 100 metres below the ground. Trained back to [[Krak\u00f3w]] and had a rest at our apartment. Walked into the old city once again and visited a bar called Hevre which was an old chapel with frescos on the walls converted into a beer house. Tried beer with syrup with ginger and raspberry ([[Bryony]] enjoyed, [[Luke]] hated), before drifting into the square for food. Had bruschetta and a really good pizza each at La Grande Mama where Bry had a honey and apple pizza and Luke the pizza named after the restaurant. Wandered back to our flat, grabbing an awful rose flavoured donut and better apple/pear and cranberry/pomegranate donut to compensate, finishing with a coffee.</p>\n\n<h2>Thursday 10th August</h2>\n\n<p>Woke up slowly and went to drop out bags off at lockers at the station before grabbing a pastry breakfast. Walked into the old town to grab a coffee from McDonalds and meet for the Jewish Quarter walking tour which was very good but finished with a sad story as to why the ghetto finished in 1943. Caught the train back into [[Krak\u00f3w]] and collected our bags and caught the train to the airport, trying to ignore the incredibly loud family (who then happened to be on our flight). Had a meal in Boccone Trattoria in the airport as [[Bryony]] saw it had a robot waiter which served us pizza and beer. Suddenly we heard an announcement about our gate being called early so had to down the beer and pizza as fast as possible. False alarm as it was the plane before us. Otherwise uneventful flight trying to avoid the family. On drive home, tried to stop at the Bakehouse but it was shut so ended up at Vita Bella. Most awkward overpriced restaurant ever. \u00a333 spaghetti with meatballs was very average and waiters all wore white gloves and were creepily attentive and cleaned the table between every meal.</p>\n\n<h2>Key Question</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Where do the horses that carry people around the center shit?
