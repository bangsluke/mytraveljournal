# [[Krak√≥w]] Summer Holiday
## August 2023

### Monday 7th August

Flew out early in the morning from [[Stansted]] with [[RyanAir]] after having a quick pint and breakfast in Wetherspoons. Arrived in [[Krak√≥w]] and took the train into the centre and found our way to our hotel room, called Central Palace, which was excellent. Had a quick lunch of pretzels ü•® and then joined a walking tour around [[Krak√≥w]] Old Town, climbing up to the castle to finish. Wandered back down to see the [[Krak√≥w]] dragon blowing flames before heading into the centre to have beers and cocktails in the central square at Europejska cafe. Had a great dinner of ribs, dumplings and cabbage pancakes at Go≈õcinna Chata Restaurant before heading back to bed.

### Tuesday 8th August

Woke up and walked into the nearby train station to grab breakfast from a Carrefour. Took our yogurt and granola back to our apartment and had some coffee and chilled for a bit, booking up activities for the following days. Walked into the town centre, visited the Basilica in the central square and had a lunch of Polish soup in a bread bowl and a chicken broth at Chopin Restaurant. Did a Secret Spy mission walking around [[Krak√≥w]] solving clues and having a laugh, including having to do a secret set of instructions in a public square and whispering a secret word to an undercover agent. Finished the mission successfully and had a beer in the square listening to the Hungarian music for culture day.


### Wednesday 9th August

Got up early and had a quick breakfast of granola and yogurt. Caught the train over to visit the Wieliczka Salt Mine and saw the St. Kinga Chapel and various other chambers. Had some pork knuckle, turkey kiev and chips for lunch over 100 metres below the ground. Trained back to [[Krak√≥w]] and had a rest at our apartment. Walked into the old city once again and visited a bar called Hevre which was an old chapel with frescos on the walls converted into a beer house. Tried beer with syrup with ginger and raspberry ([[Bryony]] enjoyed, [[Luke]] hated), before drifting into the square for food. Had bruschetta and a really good pizza each at La Grande Mama where Bry had a honey and apple pizza and Luke the pizza named after the restaurant. Wandered back to our flat, grabbing an awful rose flavoured donut and better apple/pear and cranberry/pomegranate donut to compensate, finishing with a coffee.


### Thursday 10th August

Woke up slowly and went to drop out bags off at lockers at the station before grabbing a pastry breakfast. Walked into the old town to grab a coffee from McDonalds and meet for the Jewish Quarter walking tour which was very good but finished with a sad story as to why the ghetto finished in 1943. Caught the train back into [[Krak√≥w]] and collected our bags and caught the train to the airport. Had a meal in Boccone Trattoria in the airport as [[Bryony]] saw it had a robot waiter which served us pizza and beer.


## Key memories
- Laughing doing the set of instructions in the public square for the Spy mission üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.
